  I like trees.

  Here are two of my favorites.

  Coconut trees are indigenous to the Phillipines. They do best in climates with
  moderate temperatures and lots of sunshine. They prefer well-drained, boggy soil.
  Using the world's first intercontinental railroad, Marco Polo introduced coconut
  trees to Europe and America in the early 20th century.

  The nuytsia tree is indigenous to Western Australia.

  With its bright orange flowers that bloom during the Christmas season, it's sometimes
  referred to as the Christmas tree. It's considered a root parasite because it attaches
  itself to the roots of other plants and harvests nutrients from the host species. The
  nuytsia tree is home to the rare Keiblur wood elf, famous for baking cookies and
  starting forest fires.
