<h1>Scratch - Imagine, Program, Share</h1>
<h3>
  Scratch is a programming language environment designed to help
  kids get excited about programming, graphics, and game software.
  Scratch's logo is the cat shown below, and the cat's name is
  Scratch. Scratch gets excited around mice. See what happens
  when you hover your mouse on Scratch and click him.
