  <h3>Electricity from Photovoltaic Solar Collectors</h3>

    <a href="http://www.seia.org/policy/distributed-solar/net-metering"
    target="_blank">Net-metering</a> allows customers to sell locally
    generated electric power to the utility at retail price. This makes
    photovoltaic solar collectors cost-competitive in sunny regions
    where there is <a href="areaDescription.html">no shading from
    nearby trees or structures</a>.

  <h3>Support for Electric Utilities</h3>
  <p>
    Since times of maximum sunshine roughly correspond to times of
    maximum electrical demand and power costs more at those times,
    PV solar power is worth more than average electrical power. For
    how progressive utilities like San Diego Gas and Electric benefit,
    see <a href=
    "http://www.energybiz.com/magazine/article/325109/dawn-microgrids"
    target="_blank">EnergyBiz article</a>. Power transistors that make
    conversions between DC and AC power can also provide power
    conditioning <a href="services.html">services</a> to regional
    utilities.

  <h3>Cogeneration</h3>
  <p>
    The hot exhaust and other heat from the engine driving an electric
    generator can be used for thermal processes and to heat buildings.
    This is called <em>combined heat and power</em> (CHP) or 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogeneration" target="_blank">
    cogeneration</a>. Heat generated by this means in industrial East
    Lawrence could be distributed in insulated underground pipes to
    adjacent residences and the central downtown area in what is called
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_heating" target=
    "_blank"> district heating</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the natural gas for CHP plants might be excess methane from
    <a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/biomass/anaerobic.html" target=
    "_blank"> anaerobic digestion</a> at the city's sewage treatment
    plant on the east side of East Lawrence. Electricity generated by
    CHP at all times of year would help power
    <a href="microgridPossibilities.html#examples">East Lawrence
    industry and residences</a>. Also, downtown restaurants might
    generate some of their electricity with CHP.

  <h3>Energy Storage</h3>
  <p>
    In summer, electricity generated by PV can
    <a href="typicalProperty.html">chill water</a> in storage tanks for
    later cooling. This shifts the noon peak in PV generation to the
    later peak in consumption. The storage rate can be varied to offset
    variations in PV output created by passing clouds. In winter, heat
    from CHP making electricity can heat water in (the same) storage
    tanks. This transfers excess heat generated in the day when
    electricity is most needed to night when heat is most needed.
