<h2>Summertime Power in a Small (3000 sqft) Shop or Restaurant</h2>
<div class="table">
  <div class="row">
    <p class="cell">
      The smallest electrical system in Lawrence's downtown is the
      electrical system in one small shop or restaurant, which typically
      occupies one lot and is two stories tall. One lot is 25 feet wide
      and 120 feet deep.
    </p>
    <p class="cell"> 
      Most of the downtown properties are this size. However, some are
      taller and/or occupy two or more lots. For one of these larger
      properties, scale up the values in the table below.

<h3>Typical System Description</h3>
<div class="table">
  <div class="row">
    <p class="cell">
      To avoid rooftop HVAC clutter, maximize efficiency, and facilitate
      thermal storage, a ground-source heat pump heats and cools water for
      HVAC and provides free heat for domestic hot water during the
      cooling season. Peak electrical consumption (at 4:00 PM) is about
      7.5 kW. At peak cooling load, the HVAC equipment consumes 4 kW.
    </p>
    <p class="cell">
      At noon, the HVAC cooling equipment uses 2 kW to cool spaces and 2
      kW to chill water for storage and use at a later time. Chilled-water
      storage between 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM stores enough cooling to provide
      maximum cooling for 3 evening hours. With 15% capacity factor (50%
      clouds), solar collectors rated at 18 kW save $3300/year.
    </p>
  </div>

<h3>Assumptions</h3>  
<div class="table">
  <div class="row">
    <p class="cell">
      Although the average annual price of electricity in Lawrence is
      $0.10/kWh, we assume $0.14/kWh because solar generation and storage
      provide peaking power, which is more valuable than baseload power. 
    </p>
    <p class="cell">
      The HVAC unit is a 5-ton Carrier 50YER ground-source heat pump.
      Chilled water is stored in a 2000 gal Westheffer tank. Electricity
      is stored in an 18 kWh M100 Aquion sodium-ion battery module.
