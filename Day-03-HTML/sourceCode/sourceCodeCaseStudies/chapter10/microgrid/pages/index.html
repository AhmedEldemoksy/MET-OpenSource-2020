      The street map on the left contains six regions surrounded by
      hidden boundary lines: Dam and Hydroelectric, Downtown Lawrence,
      East Lawrence Residential, East Lawrence Industrial, Old West
      Lawrence, and University of Kansas.
    </div>
    <div>
      Moving the cursor from outside to inside one of these regions
      generates a pop-up box that identifies the region just entered.
      Clicking within any region displays a representative image in
      the frame on the right.

<p class="downtown">
  <span class="title">Downtown Lawrence</span> comprises about 20 city
  blocks between South Park and the Kansas River. This area includes a
  county courthouse, an art center, a library, the city hall, offices,
  apartments, and two hotels. <span class="opportunity">It also has many
  parking lots and attached shops and restaurants with roofs of similar
  height that could accommodate solar collectors.</span>
</p>
<p class="eastLawrence">
  East of downtown is an 80-block area called <span class="title">East
  Lawrence</span>. The western half is residential with many small houses
  and a grade school. The eastern half is industrial, with manufacturing
  buildings, warehouses, a railroad station and tracks, open parking
  areas, a rock-crushing plant, and the city's sewage plant. <span
  class="opportunity">Solar collectors could cover parking areas and flat
  industrial roofs. With combined heat and power (CHP), this area's
  industry might also provide efficient heat and electricity for itself,
  adjacent residences, and the nearby downtown.</span>
</p>
<p class="westLawrence">
  West of downtown is an 80-block area called <span class="title">Old
  West Lawrence</span>. The southern two-thirds is residential and
  includes a grade school. The northern third has several medical
  facilities with large parking lots, and there is some industrial land
  by railroad tracks at the north end. <span class="opportunity">Solar
  collectors could go on the school, medical, and industrial properties,
  and on residence roofs not obstructed by trees.</span> 
</p>
<p class="ku">
  Southwest of Old West Lawrence is <span class="title">The University of
  Kansas</span> (KU). Before switching to utility power around 1960, KU
  produced its own heat and electricity. <span class="opportunity">Solar
  collectors could cover many KU building roofs and parking lots. And KU
  could implement a robust renewable microgrid like the one at the
  University of California San Diego.</span>
