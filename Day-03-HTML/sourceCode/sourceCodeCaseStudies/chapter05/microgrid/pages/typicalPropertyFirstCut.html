<h2>Summertime Power in a Small (3000 sqft) Shop or Restaurant</h2>
<p>
  The smallest electrical system in Lawrence's downtown is the
  electrical system in one small shop or restaurant, which typically
  occupies one lot and is two stories tall. One lot is 25 feet wide
  and 120 feet deep. 
  Most of the downtown properties are this size. However, some are
  taller and/or occupy two or more lots. For one of these larger
  properties, scale up the values in the table below.

<h3>Typical System Description</h3>
<p>
  To avoid rooftop HVAC clutter, maximize efficiency, and facilitate
  thermal storage, a ground-source heat pump heats and cools water for
  HVAC and provides free heat for domestic hot water during the
  cooling season. Peak electrical consumption (at 4:00 PM) is about
  7.5 kW. At peak cooling load, the HVAC equipment consumes 4 kW.
  At noon, the HVAC cooling equipment uses 2 kW to cool spaces and 2
  kW to chill water for storage and use at a later time. Chilled-water
  storage between 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM stores enough cooling to provide
  maximum cooling for 3 evening hours. With 15% capacity factor (50%
  clouds), solar collectors rated at 18 kW save $3300/year.
</p>
<h3>Assumptions</h3>  
<p>
  Although the average annual price of electricity in Lawrence is
  $0.10/kWh, we assume $0.14/kWh because solar generation and storage
  provide peaking power, which is more valuable than baseload power. 
  The HVAC unit is a 5-ton Carrier 50YER ground-source heat pump.
  Chilled water is stored in a 2000 gal Westheffer tank. Electricity
  is stored in an 18 kWh M100 Aquion sodium-ion battery module.
